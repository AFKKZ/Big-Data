5. Week 05: Frequent Itemset Mining
i. A-Priori Algorithm
a. Related Problem
Finds sets of items that frequently appear together in transactions and creates rules about item relationships.
b. Input/Output
? Input:
- Transaction database
- Support threshold (minimum frequency requirement)
- Confidence threshold (minimum strength for rules)
? Output:
- All frequent itemsets meeting the support threshold
- Association rules meeting the confidence threshold
c. Pseudocode
A-Priori first identifies frequent single items, then builds larger sets step-by-step, using the knowledge that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.
d. Advantages & Disadvantages
? Advantages:
- Reduces candidate itemsets significantly
- Guarantees completeness of results
- Simple and straightforward implementation
? Disadvantages:
- Requires multiple database scans
- High memory usage with many frequent items
- Generates numerous candidate itemsets
ii. PCY Algorithm
a. Related Problem
Improves upon A-Priori for finding frequent itemsets and association rules with better memory usage.
b. Input/Output
? Input:
- Transaction database
- Support threshold (minimum frequency requirement)
- Confidence threshold (minimum strength for rules)
? Output:
- All frequent itemsets meeting the support threshold
- Association rules meeting the confidence threshold
c. Pseudocode
PCY utilizes unused memory during the first pass by hashing potential pairs into buckets, then uses a bitmap to filter candidates in the second pass.
d. Advantages & Disadvantages
? Advantages:
- Makes better use of available memory
- Further reduces candidate pairs
- Maintains same pass count as A-Priori
? Disadvantages:
- Hash collisions reduce filtering effectiveness
- Still requires multiple database scans
- Increased algorithm complexity
iii. SON Algorithm
a. Related Problem
Addresses frequent itemset mining in very large databases by processing manageable chunks.
b. Input/Output
? Input:
- Transaction database
- Support threshold (minimum frequency requirement)
- Confidence threshold (minimum strength for rules)
? Output:
- All frequent itemsets meeting the support threshold
- Association rules meeting the confidence threshold
c. Pseudocode
SON divides the database into smaller portions, finds local frequent itemsets in each portion, combines these as candidates, then verifies frequency across the entire database.
d. Advantages & Disadvantages
? Advantages:
- Only requires two database passes
- Naturally supports parallel processing
- Scalable for very large databases
? Disadvantages:
- May generate excess candidates
- Second pass memory depends on candidate count
- Partition size selection affects performance
